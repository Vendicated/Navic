**Implementation**

Please consider whether your feature request is even possible. Subsonic,
the backing API of Navidrome, is very limited and does not have many
features.

- [ ] Subsonic supports this feature directly
- [ ] Subsonic does not support this feature
- [ ] Not sure
- [ ] Not sure BUT other clients have this, so it's possible somehow

You can check if it is supported [here](https://opensubsonic.netlify.app).
If it is not, there is still a chance it's possible to be added. Some things
are just simply not possible due to API limitations of either Subsonic or
Last.FM.
